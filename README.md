# object_detection_using_yolo
## YOLO means You only look once is a real-time object detection algorithm that uses a single convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict both bounding boxes and class probabilities of objects in an image

### The UI end takes the image imput from the user. The AI Backend utilizes a lightweight open-source model to perform object detection and return the resut in a JSON format. The UI frontend is added where the user can input the image

#### The Prerequisiets are:-
#### Docker : For Containerization of the application
#### Python : Flask for frontend and FAST API for connecting AI_backend and UI_frontend
#### Lightweigth Detection Model : YOLO V8
